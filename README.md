# Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) for Healthcare Reviews

## Project Overview
This repository implements Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) for healthcare reviews using the CADEC (CSIRO Adverse Drug Event Corpus) dataset. The project analyzes healthcare and medication reviews at a fine-grained level, extracting sentiments about specific aspects of patient experiences (effectiveness, side effects, dosage, etc.) rather than just overall sentiment.

## Features
- **Multiple Model Implementations**:
  - Domain-specific transformer-based ABSA models (DistilBERT), performing binary (positive/non-positive) classification.
  - Baseline sentiment models (Naive Bayes, SVM)
  - Performance comparison between approaches (including baseline vs ABSA format)
- **Comprehensive Healthcare Dataset**:
  - CADEC dataset with medication reviews and adverse drug events
  - Aspect-level annotations and robust train/dev/test splits (default 70%/15%/15%)
  - Cleaned and preprocessed datasets
- **Evaluation & Visualization**:
  - Accuracy, F1, and other metrics
  - Performance and dataset visualizations (see `dataset_stats/` and `training_plots/`)
  - Detailed analysis of model results
- **Healthcare Domain Specificity**:
  - Medication efficacy and side effects analysis
  - Patient-reported outcomes interpretation
  - Healthcare-specific sentiment classification (binary: positive vs. non-positive)
- **Explainability**:
  - LIME and SHAP explanations for model predictions (see `lime_explanations/` and `shap_explanations/`)
- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - Streamlit dashboard for interactive ABSA exploration (`streamlit_absa_dashboard.py`)
- **Data Augmentation & Feature Engineering**:
  - Scripts for augmenting minority classes and extracting domain-specific features (used in `models/absa/absa-cadec.py`)

## Dataset
The project uses the CADEC (CSIRO Adverse Drug Event Corpus) dataset with healthcare and medication reviews containing aspect-based annotations:
- `tokens`: Tokenized medication review text
- `absa1`, `absa2`, `absa3`: Aspect annotations including:
  - Position indices of aspect terms
  - Aspect category (e.g., MEDICATION#EFFICACY, MEDICATION#SIDE-EFFECT, TREATMENT#DOSAGE)
  - Sentiment polarity (0=negative, 1=neutral, 2=positive)

The CADEC dataset is designed for research on adverse drug events and patient experiences with medications, making it ideal for healthcare-focused sentiment analysis applications.

## Model Architecture
The primary ABSA model (`models/absa/absa-cadec.py`) uses DistilBERT, a lightweight transformer model, fine-tuned for aspect-based sentiment classification. The architecture includes:
- DistilBERT encoder for text representation
- Classification head for **binary sentiment prediction** (positive vs. non-positive)
- Custom data preprocessing for aspect extraction
- Domain-specific feature engineering (e.g., detecting side effects, benefits, negation)
- Class weighting to handle imbalanced data

## Data Processing
To process the CADEC dataset and generate ABSA-compatible files in the `Dataset/` folder:
1. Download the CADEC dataset and place it in the `Cadec_Data/` folder.
2. Run the processing script:
   ```bash
   python scripts/process_cadec_data.py
   ```
   - This script splits the data into training, validation, and test sets using a default ratio of 70%/15%/15% and a random seed of 42 for reproducibility.
   - You can generate detailed dataset statistics and visualizations (saved to `dataset_stats/`) by adding the `--generate-stats` flag.

## Dataset Statistics
Detailed statistics and visualizations about the dataset (e.g., sentiment distribution, aspect category distribution, token lengths) can be found in the `dataset_stats/` directory. These can be generated or updated using scripts:
```bash
# Option 1: Use the flag during initial processing
python scripts/process_cadec_data.py --generate-stats

# Option 2: Run dedicated analysis scripts (after processing)
python scripts/analyze_cadec_distribution.py
python evaluation/stats.py # Generates basic plots
```

## Setup and Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/muhabdullahd/aspectRx.git
cd aspectRx

# Recommended: Create and activate a Python virtual environment
# python -m venv absa_env
# source absa_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `absa_env\\Scripts\\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download required NLTK data and spaCy model
python -m nltk.downloader punkt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Usage

### Training the ABSA Model
This trains the main DistilBERT-based binary classification model.
```bash
cd models/absa
python absa-cadec.py
```

### Training Baseline Models
```bash
# Naive Bayes baseline
cd models/baseline
python train_baseline.py

# OR SVM baseline
cd ../svm
python train_svm_baseline.py
```

### Evaluation
- The main ABSA model (`absa-cadec.py`) performs evaluation during training and saves metrics.
- To evaluate the baseline models on the specific ABSA task format (binary classification):
  ```bash
  cd evaluation
  python test_baseline_on_absa.py # Tests Naive Bayes on ABSA format
  ```
- General evaluation metrics can be calculated using:
  ```bash
  cd evaluation
  python evaluate_metrics.py
  ```

### Visualizing Results
```bash
cd scripts
python plot_training_stats.py # Plots metrics from training logs
```
- Additional visualizations are generated during data processing/analysis (see `dataset_stats/`) and model training (see `training_plots/`).

### Running the Streamlit Dashboard
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_absa_dashboard.py
```

## Model Comparison with PyABSA

To evaluate the effectiveness of the domain-specific CADEC ABSA model, this project includes a script to compare its performance against a general-purpose ABSA model from the PyABSA library.

### Script: `scripts/compare_with_pyabsa.py`

This script performs the following steps:
1.  **Runs PyABSA**: Executes a pre-trained, general-purpose PyABSA model (Aspect Polarity Classification - APC) on the processed CADEC test set (`Dataset/cadec_absa_test.tsv`).
2.  **Loads Custom Model Results**: Reads the evaluation metrics (Accuracy and F1 score) of the custom-trained CADEC ABSA model from `results/cadec-absa/enhanced_results.json`.
3.  **Generates Comparison Plot**: Creates a bar chart comparing the Accuracy and F1 scores of the two models and saves it to `results/absa_comparison.png`.

### How to Run the Comparison

```bash
# Ensure you are in the aspectRx directory
# Activate your Python environment if you have one
# source absa_env/bin/activate 

python scripts/compare_with_pyabsa.py
```

This will output the metrics for both models and save the comparison plot.

## Results
- Main CADEC ABSA model metrics: `results/cadec-absa/metrics_cadec.json`
- Baseline model metrics (general): `results/metrics.json` (may vary based on script run)
- Comparison plot: `results/absa_comparison.png`
- Comparison script input metrics: `results/cadec-absa/enhanced_results.json`
- Training visualizations: `training_plots/`
- Dataset statistics visualizations: `dataset_stats/`
- LIME and SHAP explanations in their respective folders (`lime_explanations/`, `shap_explanations/`)
